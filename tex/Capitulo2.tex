\section{Goal-oriented Requirements Engineering}

Goal-oriented requirements engineering brings forward the intentionality behind system requirements. More than just presenting the \textit{what} and the \textit{how} of a system-to-be, it provides the justification for each requirement, that is, they also present the \textit{why}. Through a directed graph tree that begins with a root goal, goals are connected trough decomposition links. Root and higher level goals are related to strategical concerns, while lower level and leaf-goals are related to technical and operational features of the system. 

The main purpose of a goal model is to support the early process of RE, including the elicitation of social needs and dependencies, the actors involved in delivering functionality and resources, the decomposition of higher-level goals into more granular and detailed requirements chunks, the operationalization through means-end tasks and finally the comparison between different alternatives for the system-to-be. A goal model is said to be valid and complete if it follows all its syntactic rules and if all system goals are either decomposed, delegated to other actors or fulfilled by operational system tasks. 

Three frameworks/methodologies, namely KAOS, i* and TROPOS, represent the foundations for the goal model analysis used by a variety of other proposals [KAOS, i*, TROPOS]. Despite some differences among their syntax, they all share a set of core concepts:
\medskip

\large{\underline{Entities}}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Actor:} an entity that has goals and can decide autonomously how to achieve them. They represent a physical, social or software agent. E.g.: A patient, an emergency center, a doctor and a Mobile Personal Emergency System running in patient's smartphone.
\medskip

\item \textbf{Goal:} are actors' strategic interests. A goal with a clear-cut criteria for its satisfaction is called a hard goal. In opposition, softgoals has no clear-cut criteria for deciding whether they are satisfied or not and are usually associated to non-functional requirements of an actor. E.g.: vital signs are monitored, emergency is detected, emergency center is notified (hard goals) and system availability, detection precision, emergency awareness (softgoals).
\medskip

\item \textbf{Task:} an operational means to satisfy actors' goals. E.g.: monitor temperature sensor, persist vital signs data, request emergency assistance.

\end{itemize}
\medskip

\large{\underline{Relations}}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{AND/OR Decomposition:} a link that decomposes a goal/task into sub-goals/sub-tasks, meaning that all (at least one) decomposed goal(s)/task(s) must be satisfied/executed in order to satisfy its parent entity. 
\medskip

\item \textbf{Means-end:} a means to fulfil an actor's goal through the execution of an operational task by the same actor.
\medskip

\item \textbf{Contribution link:} a positive or negative contribution between a given goal/task to a softgoal. Contribution links are used for deciding between alternative goals/tasks at design time (contribution analysis).

\end{itemize}

\section{Contexts}

Context may be defined as the reification of the environment that surrounds the system operation~[FINKElSTEIN]. Contexts, as already stated, may not be static, but dynamic. An actor, that may be a system, has no control over its context of operation. Accordingly, an actor must be able to support different contexts of operation without violating its goals. Moreover, systems should be able to monitor the state of its surrounding environment and decide which alternative means will be used to fulfil its goals, as some may only be valid or optimized in specific contexts.

In GORE, dynamic contexts may affect what goals a system have to reach, the means available to meet them and also the quality achieved by each alternative[CGM]. Root goal and higher level strategical goals are not contextualized as they represent the main purpose of a system [Finkelstein]. As these goals are decomposed in more granular sub-goals, a context condition may dictate:

\begin{itemize}

\item If the goal is required for that context, limiting `what' a system should do;
\medskip

\item If a sub-goal or task is adoptable, limiting the `means' to fulfil a required goal;
\medskip

\item The positive, neutral or negative contribution of using some goal or task to another goal, usually a qualitative softgoal;

\end{itemize}

This last effect is the main focus of this work, as it is related to the GORE contribution analysis that we aim to improve.
 

\section{Dependability Analysis}

The concept of dependability is related to dependence and trust as well as the ability of a system to avoid failures that are more frequent and more severe than certain threshold. According to Avizienis et al., dependability encompasses the following attributes~[AVIZIENIS]: 

\begin{itemize}

\item Availability: readiness for correct service.
\medskip

\item Reliability: continuity of correct service.
\medskip

\item Integrity: absence of improper system alterations.
\medskip

\item Safety: absence of catastrophic consequences on the user(s) and the environment.
\medskip

\item Maintainability: ability to undergo modifications and repairs.
\medskip

\end{itemize}

Correctness is opposed to failure. A failure is a perceived deviation from system expected behaviour that may have variable degree of consequences on the user(s) and the environment. Failures are caused by a specification fault(s) or specification violation(s). In the first case, either the goals or the means to fulfil then are incorrect or incomplete. In the second case, system implementation did not followed its operational specification due to a faulty implementation or a deviation from normal behaviour took place in one or more components involved in the execution.

The scope of this work is restricted to specification violations, i.e., we assume that a system specification is valid and has no false assumptions, incompleteness or inconsistencies. Failures are caused by anomalies in the technical components or social actors participating in the execution of system tasks. Dependability analysis is used to provide estimations about different attributes related to system failures. These metrics may be specified as non-functional requirements for isolated system functionalities or for the whole system. Instead of softgoals, we use meta-requirements over functional goals with clear-cut quantitative criteria such as `99.999\%' reliable - a probabilistic value to make it compatible with the PMC estimation results.

%A holistic dependability specification has to include not only the software operation, but also the requirements for which that operation is meant. Requirements are an important factor to decide the acceptable frequency and severity of a software failure. Similarly, context is another factor in that decision. The frequency and the likelihood of failures are related to the dependability attributes of reliability, availability and integrity. Both likelihood and severity of failures are related to safety. 
%
%At early project phases, hazard resolution may involve simply getting more information about hazards or generating alternative design solutions~\cite{Leveson:1995}. In our work, we have used a qualitative means to analyse the dependability to be delivered by goals of a certain system taking into account contextual effects. Our approach improves the understanding of systems fault-causality effect and the identification of best approaches to reduce risk or even determine rates for safety or system level functional failure. Moreover, dependability requirement analysis cannot be accurately fulfilled without taking into account the context under which the system will operate.
%
%
%Avizienis et al \cite{Laprie2004} proposed a failure classification taxonomy with four viewpoints characterizing failures. In our approach, we use two categories: domain and consequence. We use the domain category to distinguish \textit{content} failures from \textit{timing} failures:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%
%\item{\textbf{Content failure}: When the content of the information delivered by a system task deviates from its specification}
%
%\item{\textbf{Timing failure}: When the time of arrival or the duration of the information delivered by some system task deviates from its specification}
%
%\end{itemize}
%
%The consequence of failures enables the definition of failures' severity. Two limiting levels are predefined and other intermediary levels could be defined for each case:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%
%\item{\textbf{Minor failure}: The harmful consequences of failures are limited or at most similar to the benefits provided by the correct operation of the system}
%
%\item{\textbf{Catastrophic failure}: The harmful consequences of failures are incommensurably higher than the benefits provided by correct operation of the system}
%
%\end{itemize}
%
%More details on the complete failure classification can be found in \cite{Laprie2004}. In our approach, a part of this taxonomy is used to guide the definition of the classes of failures severities and therefore the required level of dependability for different system goals. It also takes part in the identification of which dependability attribute is related to each contextual failure occurrence.  

\section{PRISM Probabilistic Model Checker}

The state based, probabilistic model checking technique used in this approach is supported by the PRISM model checker tool~[PRISM]. PRISM allows the modelling and analysis of systems which exhibit random or probabilistic behaviour. The decision of using PRISM as the probabilistic state based model checker was due to the number of successful case studies that have used this tool, indicating its maturity [PRISM CS], and also due to its rich environment that is able to represent different kinds of probabilistic models and their evaluations.

A model checking is a formal method that may be used for quantitative and qualitative analysis of dependability attributes as long as: 

\begin{itemize}

\item A formal system model may be built;
\medskip

\item Properties representing dependability attributes may be defined;
\medskip

\item The analysis overhead is justified, e.g., by its criticality.

\end{itemize}

As it will be explained in later sections, goal models may be easily extended with the proper information required for the verification of some important dependability attributes. The objective is to anticipate non-functional dependability violations and to support the decision of which alternatives to use in the system-to-be.


PRISM may be used for many different kinds of model evaluations depending on the abstraction level, the type of probabilistic model and the PCTL properties to be analysed. PRISM language offers a rich set of constructs that may represent system modules and components, among others architectural and design configurations. 


It will be up to the analyst and stakeholders to define which type of probabilistic model and which PCTL properties must be analysed for each different system. Dependability attributes may be relevant for any sort of system, but are certainly important for systems with some criticality degree, i.e., for those whose failure could have severe or catastrophic consequences for the user(s) and for the environment.
